## Overview
This report analyzes available data to identify home features that have a correlation with home sale prices. Included in this data is both information about fixed aspects of houses such as location, year built etc., & features that can be modified e.g. living space, utilities. As this report aims to provide insight to professionals looking to modify properties to maximize home resale value, it focuses on features included in the latter category.  
From this report, several takeaways emerge regarding the following home features:
* Heating System
* Square-footage of space available for renovation
* Qualty of construction & design

## Business Understanding
Investors interested in buying homes, renovating them & reselling them at a profit, are presented with the following dilemma: of the modifications possible to apply to a given property, what sort of changes will increase the sale price of that property thus maximizing the return on their investment?  
This report analyzes the given dataset to identify where such investors would be advised to allocate their resources in an effort to boost home resale values.

## Data
The data examined in this report describes properties located in King County, Washington and comes from the King County Assessor Data Download available from the [King County Department of Assesments webpage](https://info.kingcounty.gov/assessor/DataDownload/default.aspx). _(Some of the properties are located outside of the county proper.)_
This dataset contains information about a variety of home/property features of about 30,000 properties. Features described include general details (location, view from the home etc.) as well as details about the actual structure and layout (square-footage, utilities etc.) of the properties.  
In creating this report the following two files were used:
* [kc house data.csv](https://github.com/terminalcoder/dsc-phase-2-project-v2-5/blob/main/data/kc_house_data.csv) contains the dataset 
* [column names.md](https://github.com/terminalcoder/dsc-phase-2-project-v2-5/blob/main/data/column_names.md) contains descriptive information about each column in the dataset
