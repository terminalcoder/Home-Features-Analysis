    "## Overview\n",
    "This report analyzes available data to identify home features that have a correlation with home sale prices. Included in this data is both information about fixed aspects of houses such as location, year built etc., & features that can be modified e.g. living space, utilities. As this report aims to provide insight to professionals looking to modify properties to maximize home resale value, it focuses on features included in the latter category.  \n",
    "From this report, several takeaways emerge regarding the following home features:\n",
    "* Heating System\n",
    "* Square-footage of space available for renovation\n",
    "* Qualty of construction & workmanship\n",

Features described include general details (location, view from the home etc.) as well as details about the actual structure and layout (square-footage, utilities etc.) of the properties.  \n",

    "* Of the features with an area measured in square-feet, __living space__ is the one with the highest positive affect on price per SF. As such, any area of a property that can be modified into such a space should be converted to increase a home's value."

    "* Regarding the grade of construction & design, a somewhat surprising pattern was revealed: homes with an excellent grade were shown to sell for more money than those with higher grades (luxury, mansion). Although not impossible, it should be the subject of further investigation to understand if there are other factors, unaccounted for in this report, that justify this fact.\n",
